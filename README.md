### Hand Detection and Finger Counting using OpenCV

___

This project involves using OpenCV to detect and count the number of fingers shown by a hand in real-time through a webcam feed. The main objectives include hand detection, segmentation, and finger counting. The process can be broken down into several key steps

1. **Video Capture**: Capturing real-time video from a webcam and preprocessing each frame.

2. **Hand Detection**: Using techniques like background subtraction and thresholding to isolate the hand.

3. **Contour Detection**: Finding the hand's contour and identifying the largest one.

4. **Convex Hull and Defects**: Computing the convex hull of the hand contour and identifying convexity defects to locate finger valleys.

5. **Finger Counting**: Analyzing the defects to count the fingers, typically by detecting peaks in the contour that represent fingers.

6. **Displaying Results**: Overlaying the counted fingers on the video feed and displaying the count on the screen in real-time.
